Conflict Plan
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Identify that there is an issue. Take a moment to pause and step back. Take the moment with openness and kindness with not bantering etc and make sure the person communicating the issue is heard. Work together to come to a solution that properly addresses the voiced concern or ask for a preferred solution from the individual who brought it up.
What will the team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other mambers contribute?

We will approach the individual as a team, or elect a single representative to engage the solo worker and engage in a discussion that emphasizes the importance of teamwork.
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Try your best, but if you feel like you don't think you're getting things done, then bring it up sooner rather than later. Ask each other for a "second eye" when you feel like you've been staring at something too long. Don't be afraid to level set, break it down barney style, draw it out, ask the question several different ways to figure out the missing link.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

We will have a 1-on-1 discussion. Responsibility will fall upon the individual who notices it first to bring up the issue immediately.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

Should all attempts at a peaceful resolution fail, call in the instructor.

How often will you take breaks?

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Check in with each other in our daily team meet ups.
